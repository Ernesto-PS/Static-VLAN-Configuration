# Static-VLAN-Configuration

**Overview**

This project demonstrates static VLANs configured on Cisco switches using Packet Tracer. The network setup consists of two switches and eight computers, divided into two VLANs. The VLANs are connected via a trunk port, allowing all computers to communicate within a single subnet. This lab follows the IEEE 802.1Q standard for VLAN tagging.
